# Dragos Sargu personal web-site
A simple personal landing page with portfolio of a designer.

My job here is to convert a .sketch file (made by [this](https://www.behance.net/dragos_sargu?fbclid=IwAR1T7mY5uI0hyMioCgI-bkggJFNc1HRHWi1pLz1CHRBNYNB9dc3Q5s1gMD0) awesome guy) to HTML.

In this project I use [BEMIT](https://csswizardry.com/2015/08/bemit-taking-the-bem-naming-convention-a-step-further/) methodology, together with SCSS preprocessor and gulp tasker.

In order to run the code by yourself, in the root folder do a `npm install` and then `gulp` in your command line, or you can check a current live preview [here](https://viorelrj.github.io/dragos-sargu/).
